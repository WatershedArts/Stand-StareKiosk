###Modes
The Kiosk has three modes.

#####Mode 1 - Calibration
As the projector is an ultra short throw the image will undoubtably spill over the allocated surface. The calibration mode allows the user to define the actual projection area. 

#####Mode 2 - Allocation 
This is an experimental mode for the moment which allows the controller to define which RFID tag plays which video.

#####Mode 3 - Operation (Default)
This is the default mode. The kiosk will automatically load into this mode. It has no GUI or feedback.
